* Passage x Comunica: the Web User Interface

This project provides the code for the web interface deployed at
https://passage-org.github.io/passage-comunica.  Its objective is to
provide an easy way to edit SPARQL queries, execute them using the
~passage-comunica~ engine to get complete results, and understand the
underlying functioning of this engine.

/To build the interface, please take a look at the [[https://github.com/passage-org/passage-comunica][root of this
repository]]./
