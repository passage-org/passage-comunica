* Passage x Comunica

[[https://github.com/comunica/comunica][Comunica]] is a SPARQL query engine with an emphasis on modularity. To
ensure completeness of query results, it already includes actors such
as quad pattern fragments (qpf), or brqpf. We provide one for SPARQL
*continuation* queries [1].

** Principle

Comunica decomposes the query: Comunica is in charge of everything but
the operators handled by [[https://github.com/passage-org/passage][Passage]] (defined by the use of ~Shapes~). Our
actor sends the query to a Passage server and concatenates the results
with that of a SPARQL continuation query if it exists (sent by the
server in a ~metadata.next~ field like for the qpf actor), via
recursive calls to Comunica's engine.

/Passage does not handle full SPARQL 1.1. The recursive calls to Comunica's engine allows returning continuation queries with operators that are not handled yet: Comunica will handle them while sending the rest to Passage./

** Build and Run

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :session build :async
  yarn install && yarn build
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :session execution :async
  # It runs similarly to your good old Comunica:
  yarn run query-passage \
       http://localhost:8080/watdiv/passage \
       -q 'SELECT * WHERE {?s ?p ?o FILTER (contains(str(?s),"Product10000")) }' \
       -t 'text/csv' 2> /dev/null
#+END_SRC

** Web Server

Passage-Comunica comes with a [[https://passage-org.github.io/passage-comunica/][web query editor]]! Of course, it provides
complete and correct results despite timeouts [1]; but also autocompletion
features relying on sampling-based query services for both [[https://github.com/passage-org/passage/tree/main/raw][single
endpoints]], and [[https://github.com/GDD-Nantes/HeFQUIN-FRAW][federations of endpoints]].

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :session build_server :async
  yarn install && yarn build:web
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :session server :async
  ## Typically starts a server on http://localhost:4173/passage-comunica/
  yarn server
#+END_SRC
